            <Page>Wow.</Page>
            <Page>The view from here is incredible! That star is magnificent!</Page>
            <Page>And this moon has such beautiful peaks and valleys!</Page>
            <Page>None of the moons back home have life on them, I wonder if it's because it's so close to the planet below?</Page>
            <Page>Maybe it picked up its atmosphere from the planet after some ancient collision?</Page>
            <Page>The air here is technically breathable, but it's so thin...</Page>
            <Page>Yep, I'll keep my spacesuit on.</Page>
