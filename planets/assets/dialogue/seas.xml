            <Page>This planet is covered entirely by water and ice!</Page>
            <Page>It's quite cold because of the dim light from its star, and the constant mini-eclipses from the asteroid belt certainly haven't helped.</Page>
            <Page>However, it's warm enough that water can at least exist, and the atmosphere is perfectly breathable!</Page>
            <Page>Despite that, there appears to be no life on this planet at all.</Page>
            <Page>I wonder why life appears on some planets, but not others?</Page>
