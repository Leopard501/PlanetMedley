            <Page>Most of this planet is covered in thick water vapor fog, casting these valleys in darkness and warming them via a greenhouse effect.</Page>
            <Page>Interestingly enough, it seems its so dark and hot that life isn't possible across most of the surface!</Page>
            <Page>Despite that, these mountains are covered in grass and trees, soaking up the sunlight and enjoying the cool, oxygen rich air.</Page>
            <Page>Life appears in the strangest places.</Page>
