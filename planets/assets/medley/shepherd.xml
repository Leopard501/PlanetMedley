            <Page>This small moon appears to have cleared a gap in Big Blue's rings!</Page>
            <Page>It's gravity must be keeping the tiny particles to either side of itself, like it's shepherding them.</Page>
            <Page>Those rings sure are beautiful, I wish there was a planet with rings back home.</Page>
